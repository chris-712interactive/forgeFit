## Implementation gates

Use `hasTierFeature(tier, feature)` from `@/lib/billing/gates`.

| Gate key | Minimum tier | UI surface (planned) |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| `projection_90d` | Pro | Progress tab — projection chart horizon |
| `projection_confidence_bands` | Pro | Progress tab — shaded band |
| `projection_goal_date` | Pro | Progress tab — goal date callout |
| `strength_analytics` | Pro | Progress or Home — lift charts |
| `pr_history` | Pro | Workout / Profile — PR log |
| `volume_analytics` | Pro | Home / Progress — volume by muscle |
| `nutrition_adherence` | Pro | Nutrition tab — adherence card |
| `unlimited_history` | Pro | All charts — drop 90-day truncation |
| `data_export` | Pro | Profile — export button |
| `progress_photos` | Pro | Progress tab — photo timeline |
| `rule_based_insights` | Pro | Home / Progress — insight cards |
| `device_integrations` | Pro+ | Profile — Integrations hub; workout device intensity + readiness |
| `restaurant_search` | Pro+ | Nutrition — eating out quick-log |
| `ai_motivation` | Pro+ | Home / pre-workout — AI copy |
| `gamification` | Pro+ | Profile opt-in + leaderboard |
| `pr_celebration` | Pro+ | Workout — celebration modal |

### Free-tier limits (constants)

| Constant | Value | Applies to |
|----------|-------|------------|
| `FREE_PROJECTION_HORIZON_DAYS` | 30 | Projection engine output |
| `FREE_ANALYTICS_HISTORY_DAYS` | 90 | Chart queries, trend windows |

Logging itself is **never** capped — only analytics views and projection horizon.

## Stripe mapping

| Product | Monthly price ID env | Annual price ID env | `subscription_tier` |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| ForgeRep Pro | `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY` | `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL` | `pro` |
| ForgeRep Pro+ | `STRIPE_PRO_PLUS_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY` | `STRIPE_PRO_PLUS_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL` | `pro_plus` |

Webhook `syncSubscriptionToProfile` resolves tier from the subscription's active price ID.

Also handles **`checkout.session.completed`** (reliable backup when subscription metadata is on the session).

Checkout success redirect calls **`POST /api/stripe/sync`** to pull the active subscription immediately (covers webhook delays / misconfigured endpoints).

Checkout accepts `{ tier: "pro" | "pro_plus", interval: "monthly" | "annual" }`.

### Legacy env vars

`STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY` / `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL` map to **Pro** if the new `STRIPE_PRO_*` vars are unset (backward compatible).

---

## Upgrade & downgrade rules

- **Free → Pro / Pro+:** Stripe Checkout; webhook sets tier on `active` or `trialing`.
- **Pro ↔ Pro+:** `POST /api/stripe/subscription/change` updates the existing Stripe subscription (no second subscription).
- **Return to Free:** `POST /api/stripe/subscription/cancel` sets `cancel_at_period_end` (access until period end) or immediate cancel.
- **Resume cancel:** `POST /api/stripe/subscription/resume` clears `cancel_at_period_end`.
- **Payment method / invoices:** `POST /api/stripe/portal` → Stripe Customer Portal.
- **Cancel (webhook):** `customer.subscription.deleted` → tier `free`, status `canceled`.
- **Pro+ subscriber** always passes Pro gates (`hasProAccess` is true for both `pro` and `pro_plus`).

## Phase ownership

| Phase | Tier scope |
|-------|------------|
| Phase 7 | Stripe billing, Pro gates (projections, analytics), Pro+ integrations |
| Phase 8 | Pro+ only — AI motivation, gamification, PR celebration |

Pro analytics UI can ship incrementally; gates should land before or with each surface.

## Operational margins

See [ADR 001 — Two-Tier Pricing & Operational Margins](./ADRs/001-tier-pricing-margins.md).

| Tier / plan | Gross margin (est.) | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Pro annual | **~94%** | No paid APIs; single Stripe charge |
| Pro monthly | **~92%** | Higher Stripe fee (12 charges/yr) |
| Pro+ annual | **~82–87%** | Device sync + AI variable cost (restaurant MVP is $0) |

The 35% Pro annual discount is a **retention trade**, not a margin problem — annual billing saves ~$4.40/user/yr in Stripe fees vs monthly.
